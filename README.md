# Hydro-thermal-Economic-Scheduling-using-Dynamic-Programming
To satisfy the electrical load over 24-hour period, a hydro unit is available in addition to 2 thermal units. The hydro unit has a limited Volume of water and should be operated in parallel with thermal units in such a way that the overall operating cost of thermal units is minimized for the given period of 24 hour. Aim of this project is to obtain the optimal load dispatch for the hydrothermal system by utilizing incremental dynamic programming approach and then calculate the output of the thermal and hydro units, hourly discharge of hydro plant, Volume states of hydro reservoir, corresponding running cost of thermal plants, transmission loss and Penalty factors (hydro and thermal) for a period of 24 hours.
The Project report's(given pdf-my project) part 2 contain the solution to this problem.  This project has been done by me as a course requirment of my grad school. The  full draft report  has been given for reader's better understaning.
